# nemo

`nemo` finds the [largest empty
circle](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~adanner/cs97/s08/papers/schuster.pdf)
in the plane whose interior does not overlap with any given obstacles.
`nemo` includes ony two functions :

  - `nemo_hull` computes a concave hull from a set of points and is
    basically imported from package
    [concaveman](https://github.com/mapbox/concaveman) brought in R by
    \[@joelgombin\](<https://github.com/joelgombin/concaveman>) )
  - `nemo_circle` computes the larget circle inside a hull and which
    doesnâ€™t include any point
