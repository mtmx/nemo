# nemo

`nemo` finds the [largest empty
circle](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~adanner/cs97/s08/papers/schuster.pdf)
in the plane whose interior does not overlap with any given obstacles.
`nemo` includes ony two functions :

  - `nemo_hull` computes a concave hull from a set of points and is
    basically imported from package
    [concaveman](https://github.com/mapbox/concaveman) brought in R by
    [joelgombin](https://github.com/joelgombin/concaveman)
  - `nemo_circle` computes the larget circle inside a hull and which
    doesnâ€™t include any point : its center will be the point nemo

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mtmx/nemo) with:

``` r
## install {remotes} if not already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
## install nemo for github
remotes::install_github("mtmx/nemo")
```

## Example

A basic example to find the largest empty circle inside a set of points
and its center aka the point nemo :

``` r
library(nemo)
data(points)
hull_pts <-
nemo_hull(points = points %>% st_transform(2154),
            concavity =2,
            length_threshold = 10)

nemo_pts <-
nemo_circle(points = points %>% st_transform(2154),
            hull = hull_pts %>% st_buffer(dist=500),
            strict_inclusion = T,
            nmax_circles = 1)
#> Warning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant
#> throughout all geometries

# mapping output
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = hull_pts %>% st_buffer(dist=500)  , size = 0.2) +
  geom_sf(data = nemo_pts ,
          size = 1,
          fill=NA,
          color = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = nemo_pts %>% st_centroid() ,
             size = 1,
             col = "red") +
  geom_sf(data=points %>% st_transform(2154))
#> Warning in st_centroid.sf(.): st_centroid assumes attributes are constant
#> over geometries of x
```
